# What is Drupal?
## A Brief Description
Websites are often thought of as a collection of static pages, perhaps with some functions like a blog or a comments section. When they go to manage their site, they are thinking in terms of a tree-like hierarchy of pages that they will edit.

**The University of Guelph Business Web Solutions** department uses a **Content Management System** (CMS) called **Drupal**. Drupal, unlike traditional websites, treats most [Content Types](Drupal_Features_Terms_Acroynms.md#Content Type)  as variations on the same concept: a *Node* (more on this in a moment). Static pages, blog posts, and news items (some possible node types) are all stored in the same way, and the site's navigation structure is designed separately by editing menus, views (lists of content), and blocks.

## Where to Start?
A lot can be accomplished through the GUI. Exploring the GUI is probably the best way to learn how to use Drupal.
