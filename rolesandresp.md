# Drupal User Roles and Responsibilities
Provided with the current UG Drupal CMS, there are three main user roles. These roles are: 

## [Web Managers / Site Owners](webman.md)
A user with the role of **Site Manager** can edit and manage users, basic site layout, changing view categories, Titles, and number of items to display, creation of menus, and configuration of site specific taxonomies. The role of a site manager is to ensure AODA compliancy and to monitor for any broken links and misspellings using SiteImprove. We recommend that there only be 1-2 Site Managers to ensure that site maintenance and conformity to WCAG 2.0 Standards is kept and that the ability to divide up responsibility is easier to achieve and enforce.

## [Content Creators & Content Editors](contentcreators.md)
A user with the role of **Content Creator OR Content Editors** have the ability to create and edit the various content types provided with the UG Drupal platform. Under the Content Creator category there are two different types.

These types of Content Creators are:

* **Authors**: Ability to create, edit and publish/unpublish their OWN content.
* **Editors**: Ability to create, edit, and publish/unpublish any content produced by them or others.
