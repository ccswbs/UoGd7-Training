# Drupal User Roles and Responsibilities
Provided with the current UG Drupal CMS, there are three main user roles. These roles are: 

## [Web Managers/Site Owners](webman.md)
A user with the role of **Site Manager** can edit and manage users, basic site layout, view categories, titles, menus, site-specific taxonomies, and more. The role of a site manager is to ensure AODA compliance and to monitor for any broken links and misspellings using Siteimprove. We recommend that there only be 1-2 Site Managers to ensure that site maintenance and conformity to WCAG 2.0 Standards is kept and that the ability to divide up responsibility is easier to achieve and enforce.

## [Content Creators & Content Editors](contentcreators.md)
A user with the role of **Content Creator OR Content Editor** has the ability to create and edit the various content types provided with the UG Drupal platform. There are two types of Content Creator.

Types of Content Creators are:

* **Authors**: Ability to create, edit and publish/unpublish their OWN content.
* **Editors**: Ability to create, edit, and publish/unpublish any content produced by them or others.
