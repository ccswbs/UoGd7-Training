# Drupal User Roles & Responsibilities

Provided with the current UG Drupal CMS, there are three main user roles. These roles are:

### Web Managers/Site Owners

A user with the role of **Site Manager** can edit and manage users, basic site layout, view categories, titles, menus, site-specific taxonomies, and more. The role of a site manager is to ensure AODA compliance and to monitor for any broken links and misspellings using Siteimprove. We recommend that there only be 1-2 Site Managers to ensure that site maintenance and conformity to WCAG 2.0 Standards is kept and that the ability to divide up responsibility is easier to achieve and enforce.

As a Web Manager/Site Owner, you have the responsibility of ensuring accessibility for the users of the website you manage. The University of Guelph has a goal for all websites to be Level AA Compliant in regards to [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Normative Criteria.

To manage the other Content Creators/Editors, it is necessary that you have a fundamental understanding of these criteria and to ensure you are within the guidelines. It is also important that you communicate and train your Content Creators/Editors on how to publish content in an accessible way.

A good place to start in regards to accessibility testing is finding tools that can assist you in getting a quick overview of issues. For large websites the effort most likely needs to be prioritized.

### Content Creators & Content Editors

A user with the role of **Content Creator OR Content Editor** has the ability to create and edit the various content types provided with the UG Drupal platform. There are two types of Content Creator.

Types of Content Creators are:

* **Authors**: Ability to create, edit and publish/unpublish their OWN content.
* **Editors**: Ability to create, edit, and publish/unpublish any content produced by them or others.

As a **Content Creator or Content Editor** you must familiarize yourself with the normative criteria of [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). Content Creators and Content Editors are responsible for ensuring the accessibility of any web content that they upload or publish on the website. In many cases the Drupal Platform will cover the basic WCAG 2.0 Criteria but it is up to the Content Creator/Content Editor to ensure that the content they produce is WCAG 2.0 compliant.
