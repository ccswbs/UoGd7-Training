# How to Create FAQ
The *Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)* feature allows **content editors** to create a repository of commonly asked questions and their corresponding answers. The 'FAQ' page is automatically generated from the FAQ nodes configured and the layout of this page can be modified on the settings page.
