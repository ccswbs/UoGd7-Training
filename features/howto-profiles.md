# How to Add People Profiles

The people profiles feature allows **Content Creators** to create and edit an organizational profile. Anonymous users can browse through these profiles in a listing page view and find more detail about a specific member of an organization by clicking on the preferred member's name.

**Before creating a profile, the following vocabularies are suggested to be filled with terms otherwise most of the people profile features won't be usable.**

## Creating Terms for Vocabularies

Add terms to the following:

* **Profile Category:** This is a way to filter views. Examples: *Create a teaser view for specific departments within a college*
* **Profile Field Headings:** This is for adding field headings that are not supported by the platform. Examples: *Publication, Awards, etc*
* **Roles:** Clients can create any number of positions/roles for their needs. Examples: *Staff, Faculty, Students, Co-op, etc.*
* **Area of Research:** If applicable, you can describe the different areas of research for your department/users. This is not mandatory. Example:  *Molecular Interactions of Dihydrogen Monoxide*
* **Unit:** This describes the title of the department or faculty an individual is a part of. Examples: *Department of Psychology* or *Student Affairs*.
* **Sub-Unit:** This is the sub-unit of a department. Example: *Web Business Solutions* is a sub-unit of *CCS*
