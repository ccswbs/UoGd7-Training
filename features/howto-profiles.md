# How to Add People Profiles

The people profiles feature allows **Content Creators** to create and edit an organizational profile. Anonymous users can browse through these profiles in a listing page view and find more detail about a specific member of an organization by clicking on that member's name.

## Creating Terms for Vocabularies

Before creating a profile, it is suggested that the following vocabularies are filled with terms. Otherwise, most of the people profile features will be unusable

Add terms to the following:

* **Profile Category:** This is a way to filter views. Example: *create a teaser view for specific departments within a college*.
* **Profile Field Headings:** This is for adding extra field headings that are not already supported by the platform. Examples: *Research, Education, Selected Publications, etc.*
* **Roles:** Clients can create any number of positions/roles for their needs. Examples: *Staff, Faculty, Students, Co-op, etc.*
* **Area of Research:** If applicable, you can describe the different areas of research for your department/users. This is optional. Example: *Molecular Interactions of Dihydrogen Monoxide*
* **Unit:** This describes the title of the department or faculty an individual is a part of.
* **Sub-Unit:** This is the sub-unit of a department. Example: *Web Business Solutions* is a sub-unit of *CCS*.

###How to Add Volcabulary Terms

1. Using the administration bar, navigate to `Structure` > `Taxonomy`.
2. You will see a long list of vocabularies. Five of these vocabularies are related to people profiles: `profile cateogry`, `profile field labels`, `profile role`, `profile sub unit`, and `profile unit`. Select `list terms` for the vocaubulary you would like to add terms to. 
2. From the vocabulary (list of terms) page, select `Add term`. 
3. Enter a name for the term. Enter a description if needed. 
4. Select `Save`. 

####Taxonomy: Profile Field Labels

This vocabulary allows you to add custom fields to your people profiles. Add terms to this vocabulary to determine the field labels. For instance, if the field were to show "*Interests:*  Sports", then "Interests" would be a term in the `profile field labels` category.

Custom fiels can be added through the "*PROFILE FIELDS*" section that appears when creating or editing a profile. The Label dropdown menu is populated with the terms from the vocabulary above. Fields will appear in the same order as they are entered, but can be reordered by dragging. Custom fields will always appear _after_  preset fields (i.e. Email, Phone Number, Fax, Office, and Lab).

Do not confuse this vocabulary with `profile section labels` vocabulary, which is used for adding larger text entry sections. 

##How to Add People Profiles

1. On the Administration bar, navigate to `Add Content` > `Profile`.
4. Begin filling out the profile, starting with adding a **Preferred name** and **Last name**.
7. Many of the fields in the profile are optional, but it is recommded to add at least a name, role, and contact information.
12. Add any related **File** or **Image Attachments**. Remember to select `Upload` after choosing your file. 
15. If the member also has a `Website Link` then include a **title** and **URL**.
16. In order to add `Profile Sections`, select a value under **Heading** and enter any **Content** needed. Keep in mind that by clicking **Add another item**, you can add as many `Profile Sections` as you like.
