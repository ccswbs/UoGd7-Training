# How to Add Book Page

The Book Feature permits **content creators** to organize content into ordered sections, similar to the chapters and pages of physical books.

Books have a built-in hierarchical navigation, which means that they can be organized to be read in a particular order. Each book page contains a link to its parent page, as well as to the previous and next pages in the order specified.
