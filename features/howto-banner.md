## How to Filter Banners by Category on Specific Pages
With the following steps, you can create a banner slideshow that is (a) filtered by a specific category and will (b) only show on specific pages. I've also included steps to change the number of items.

1. Creating a Banner Category
   - Under Structure / Taxonomy / Banner category, add a term to identify each unique slideshow (eg. Front Page).
   - Take note of the term ID associated with your new term (you can find this is the URL when you edit the term after creating one and clicking the edit button ). Write it down or remember it for later.
