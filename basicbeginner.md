2. To `login` use your Central Login ID and Password in the user login fields.

## How to Perform Administration and Content Tasks
To add any type of pre-defined content, the methods are the same. When Logged in as a Site Manager or Content Creator the first bar at the top of the page is called the **Administration Menu Bar** and it allows users with the correct permissions to add/view/delete/edit content as well as other administration specific tasks.

## Finding and Editing Content
All content created on your website can be viewed by selecting the `Find Content` shortcut located on the Administration Menu shortcut bar, or by selecting `Content` on the Administration Menu bar itself.

## How to Create Content
**Add Content:**  To create new content on your website, select the `Add Content` shortcut located on the **Administration Bar**.
**Example of Content Types:**  Banner, Event, Feature, News, Page, Social Media.

## Adding Users
Request that new users attempt to login to the site - this provides their Username (which is their Central Login-ID for U of G staff).

1. At the top of the **Administration Menu Bar** select `People`.
2. Either use the filter or scroll down to find the Username.
3. Select appropriate Username.
4. Select `Role` (i.e. editor).
5. Enter a *random* password information (It will not be retained since the Central Login ID and Password will override and provide access to the website).
6. Select `Save`.

*Note: If you already know the Central Login-ID and email address, or the user is not U of G authenticated, accounts can be set-up without having the user attempt the initial login.*

## Common Web Errors
When creating, editing or managing content with the Drupal platform there are a few common web errors that you should look out for. These web errors are not only found on our Drupal platform, so they're benificial to know and understand their causes.
These common web errors include:

* **Error 404**: This error arises when the URL you have navigated to points to something that does not exist. Common causes of this error are typos in the URL provided when clicking a link, deletion/non existance of the node in which the URL links too. To fix these problems, simply update the link with the correct one, create the page in which the link points too or add a URL Alias to a page that should have this link but doesnt.
* **Error 403**: This error arises when the user does not have permission to access the URL they have navigated to. Common causes of this error are unauthenticated users (users not logged in to the website) trying to access webpages that are either unpublished or privated. Pages that are private may also limit access to specific types of users through their authentication privlidges.
* **Error 500**: This error arises when the webpage you have navigated to has problems connecting with its back-end server. This is most commonly seen from a content creator/editor and site manager point of view. Common causes of this error are timing out (more common) or input of incorrect information during critical periods (less common). To fix this error, simply refresh the page. If the error persists ensure that the data in which you are inputting is correct, then contact your Web Manager / Site Owner.
