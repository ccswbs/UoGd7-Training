# Boostrap Classes

Bootstrap is an open-source front-end framework that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create responsive webpages. Bootstrap is used to build themes and templates.

Example classes include:

* Lead
* Panel
* Well
* Alert
* Jumbotron

## Lead

Lead is a class that can emphasize text. This is very useful when you would like to draw the user's attention to a piece of text that is not a heading. To ensure content is accessible, avoid using heading tags soley to make text appear larger. Heading tags should be used in logical order and only when they head content.

To implement Lead, add `class="lead"` to an HTML element, such as:

* `<p class="lead">Example paragraph text.</p>`
* `<ul class="lead">`
