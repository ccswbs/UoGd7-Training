#H.A.L.T.

This module is designed as an overview of techniques that content creators can use to make websites more accessible.
Small changes based on these guidelines will make a big difference for assistive technology users. 

Most of the information presented here requires a basic understanding of hypertext markup language (HTML). This programming language
uses a system of tags to control the presentation of information on a web page. Anyone can view the HTML version of a webpage by
right-clicking on the page and selecting `View page source.`

H.A.L.T addresses some common accessibility issues for static content commonly found on basic pages on the Drupal content management
system (CMS). 

##Headings

For users who cannot visually perceive the layout of information on a web page, assistive technology helps them navigate quickly by reading a list of headings found on the page. However, assitive technology can only tell that a piece of text is a content heading if the code indicates that it is. This is why it is the responsibility of content creators to add the HTML tags required to denote headings. 

In HTML, headings are denoted with `<h>` tags. These tags have six levels, which look like this: 
* `<h1>`
* `<h2>`
* `<h3>`
* `<h4>`
* `<h5>`
* `<h6>`

When using Drupal, you can set headings with the text editor, also known as the WYSIWYG editor. Highlight some text, and then select a heading level from the dropdown menu:

For each piece of text, the bottom bar of the text editor lists the HTML elements it is marked up with, including any heading tags.
