## What are content types?

The expression "Content types" is used to describe basic types of content that you will find in every drupal site. Basic examples of content types used by every site are page, news and events. Organising nodes into different content types allows drupal to automatically know what type of information the node requires and what special fields are associated with that content type. Content types allow content creators to easily create and organise similar types of content they create in an easy to manage manner.

## Why are there specific content types?
CCS Web & Development solutuons has customised and tested the current content types. The customization and testing of the content types was to ensure that the content type is in fact accessible and standard across the UG Drupal platform. The content types that are currently availiable on the UG Drupal platform are constantly undergoing accessibility testing as well as help to ensure that university sites follow a similar uniform platform. Through a uniform platform, navigation between university and college websites is made simpler and easy for the user. If you happen to find any issues/problems with current content types please contact CCS so we can be aware of the issue.
