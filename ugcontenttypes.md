## What are content types?

The expression "Content types" is used to describe basic types of content that you will find in every drupal site. Basic examples of content types used by every site are page, news and events. Organising nodes into different content types allows drupal to automatically knwo what type of information the node requires and what special fields are associated with that content type. Content types allow content creators to easily create and organise similar types of content they create in an easy to manage mannor. The content types that are availiable currently on the UG Drupal platform have been checked for accessability and also ensure that the university sites follow a similar uniform platform. This also makes navigation between university college websites simple and easy for the user.

## Why are there specific content types?
CCS Web & Development solutuons has customised and tested the current content types. The customization and testing of the content types was to ensure that the content type is in fact accessible and standard across the UG Drupal platform. If you happen to find any issues/problems with current content types please contact CCS so we can be aware of the issue. If you would like to keep track of the current issues you can take a look at our current [github issues](https://github.com/ccswbs/hjckrrh/issues) .
