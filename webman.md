# Web Managers / Site Owners
As a Web Manager / Site Owner, you have the responsibility of ensuring accessibility to the users of the website you manage. The University of Guelph has a goal for all websites to be Level AA Compliant in regards to [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Normative Criteria. 

In order for you to be able to manege the other Content Creators/Editors, it is then necessary that you have a fundamental understanding of these criteria and how to ensure that you are within the guidelines. It is also important that you communicate and train your Content Creators/Editors on how to publish content in an ‘accessible way’.

Ensuring that your Content Creators/Editors create accessible furthers your site’s accessibility rather than introducing new accessibility issues in which more time will need to be spent to fix these issues. A good place to start in regards to accessibility testing is tools that can assist you in getting a quick overview of issues. For large websites the effort most likely needs to be prioritized.

The following beginning steps will help you to get started as a site owner:

## Learn About The AODA and Content Editing Standards.
**AODA Standards** – effective January 2014 website content changes must comply with provincial legislation known as the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**. The Standards governing websites is called the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0** *Level A* compliance was required in 2014 and *Level AA* compliance is required by 2021. This documentation has some information at the beginning of Chapter 2 to help get you started. You should also visit the [U of G Web Accessibility site](https://www.uoguelph.ca/accessibility/web/) for additional help and resources.

## Document Accessibility
Providing documents in a range of formats will enable people with different abilities and learning styles to choose the format that works best for them.

Word documents and PDFs uploaded to your website must be formatted and edited adequately for accessibility. The University of Guelph's **Diversity and Human Rights (DHR)** department has a [web page dedicated to helping you create accessible documents](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/information-and-communication-document-accessibility).

It is recommended that clients go through their content and ensure their documents are WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.
