# Web Managers/Site Owners

The following beginning steps will help you to get started as a site owner:

## Learn About The AODA and Content Editing Standards.
**AODA Standards** â€“ effective January 2014 website content changes must comply with provincial legislation known as the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**. The set of standards governing websites is called the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0**. *Level A* compliance was required in 2014 and *Level AA* compliance is required by 2021. This documentation has some information at the beginning of Chapter 2 to help get you started. You should also visit the [U of G Web Accessibility site](https://www.uoguelph.ca/accessibility/web/) for additional help and resources.

## Document Accessibility
Providing documents in a range of formats will enable people with different abilities and learning styles to choose the format that works best for them.

Word documents and PDFs uploaded to your website must be formatted and edited adequately for accessibility. The University of Guelph's **Diversity and Human Rights (DHR)** department has a [web page dedicated to helping you create accessible documents](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/information-and-communication-document-accessibility).

It is recommended that clients go through their content and ensure their documents are WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.

## Register for a Siteimprove Web Accessibility Course
[The Siteimprove website application](http://siteimprove.com/) is used for tracking technical compliance - for user training **Contact Diversity & Human Rights**.

## Monitor your Website for Accessibility Issues
The University of Guelph monitors the accessibility of its websites using an online web governance service called Siteimprove. Once a site is added to Siteimprove, the service will check the site for accessibility issues, broken links, and spelling mistakes that can be found through automated means. If you would like to monitor your University of Guelph website using Siteimprove, contact ccs-websolutions@uoguelph.ca. Within this email, please provide the URL of the website you wish to monitor and the name of the department associated with the website.
