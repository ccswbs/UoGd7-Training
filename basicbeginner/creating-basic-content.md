# Creating Basic Content

In order to publish content on your website, you must select a content type in which this new content should be displayed. Once you have selected the content type in which to put your content, the rest is easy.

There are a few ways to add content to your website:

### Option 1

Select the `Add Content` shortcut located in the Administration Bar. ![Add Content Button on Administration Bar](../.gitbook/assets/content%20%282%29.png)

### Option 2

Select the `Content` button in the Administration Bar and then selecting the `Add Content` option.

Both Option 1 and Option 2 will bring you to the "Add Content" menu.
