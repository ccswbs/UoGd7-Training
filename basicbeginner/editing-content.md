# Editing Pre-existing Content

All content created on your website can be viewed by selecting the `Find Content` shortcut located in the Administration Menu shortcut bar, or by selecting `Content` in the Administration Bar itself. ![Find Content Button Highlighted](../.gitbook/assets/findcontent%20%281%29.png)

Once selected, you will be brought to a page with the content listed in a table. ![Website Content Listings](../.gitbook/assets/contentmenu%20%281%29.png)

You can search for specific content through the "SHOW ONLY ITEMS WHERE" filter options. Use the drop-down menus to filter by content status and type to find what you're looking for. ![Filter and edit content options displayed](../.gitbook/assets/filterandedit%20%281%29.png)
