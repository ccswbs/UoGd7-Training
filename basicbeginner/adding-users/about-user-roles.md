# About User Roles

In Drupal, access and permissions are granted to defined user roles. User roles are in turn assigned to individual users. The U of G Drupal platform has the following predefined roles each with unique permissions allowing for different types of users with different limitations on tasks they are premitted to perform:

* Anonymous User
* Authenticated User
* Author
* Editor
* Publisher
* Site Manager

If you are not familiar with types of users \(or user roles\) you can review the [Types of UoG Users](../drupal_features_terms_acroynms.md#types-of-uog-users) in the Drupal Platform Introduction.
