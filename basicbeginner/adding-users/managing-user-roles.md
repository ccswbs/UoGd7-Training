# Managing User Roles

**Note:** The ability to manage user roles is restricted to Site Managers.

#### Changing Roles for One User

1. At the top of the Administration Menu Bar select `People`.

2. Locate the appropriate user you would like to change roles for. You can do this by either using the filter provided, scrolling through the list, or using the in-browser search feature \(ctrl + f\).
3. Once the user is located, select `edit` for that user.

4. Under the "Role" category, select or deselect the roles you would like the user to have.
   * All Unchecked \(Except Authenticated User\): User is a normal user with no creation/editing capabilities.
   * For more information on the user roles, please visit the [Drupal User Roles and Responsibilities](../rolesandresp.md) section.
   * In the example below we are adding the roles 'editor' and 'publisher' for the user.
