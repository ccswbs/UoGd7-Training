# Adding Users to the Website

Arguably the most straight forward way to add users to a website is to ask the user to log in to the site using their Central Login-ID and password \(see [How to Login](./#how-to-log-inlog-out)\). By doing this, the user is added into the system as an authenticated user of the website. Once a successful login has occurred, the user can be assigned roles by a site manager adding user roles \(see [Managing User Roles](./#managing-user-roles)\).

What if the user doesn't have a Central Login-ID or if the user is unable to login? Alternatively users can be added by an individual with the site manager role. If you already know the Central Login-ID and email address, or the user is not U of G authenticated, accounts can be set-up without having the user attempt the intial login.
