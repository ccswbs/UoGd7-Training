# Add a New User

1. At the top of the Administration Menu Bar select `People`.
2. Select `Add User`.
3. Under the "Role" category, select the roles you would like the user to have. 
   * All Unchecked \(Except Authenticated User\): User is a normal user with no content creation/editing capabilities.
   * For more information on the user roles, please visit the [Drupal User Roles and Responsibilities](../rolesandresp.md) section.
4. For the sake of saving the information you just edited, enter a _random_ password in the "Password" and "Confirm Password" field. This step is purely for the sake of saving. This password is **NOT IMPORTANT**!!! It will not be retained since the User's Central Login ID and Password will override and provide that user access to the website.
5. Leave the LDAP Options section blank.
6. Select `Save`.
