# Sidebar Menus

Sidebar menus show up on the right side of the page, beside the main body content. They can be easily customized to display a portion of the main menu on all pages, or a few select ones.

For help with creating menus, see the [Managing Menus](menuitems.md) page.

## Creating a Sidebar Menu

1. From the administration bar, navigate to `Structure` > `Blocks`.
2. At the top of the page, select `Add menu block`.
3. Enter a title for the menu block if it should be different from the default title, determined by the menu. Enter "<none>" to display no title.
4. From the Menu dropdown, select either "Main menu" to display the whole menu in the sidebar, or "<the menu selected by the page>" to only display the portion of the main menu relevant to the page.
