# Events

The Events feature allows **Content Creators** to add events to the website and display them in a Listing Page view, a Weekly Events view, a Monthly Calendar view, an Event Detail Page view, and an Upcoming Events Teaser List view. Any event can be featured on any page using the Featured Items block. Site visitors can also browse for events by date and event category.
