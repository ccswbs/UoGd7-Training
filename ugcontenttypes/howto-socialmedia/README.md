# Social Media Account

The social media feature permits **Content Creators** to add social media links to their website and display them on any page. Site visitors can click on the social media icon and be directed to the associated web page.

Drupal also allows live social media feeds to be shown on your webiste.

For a list of all social media accounts attached to a website, add `/connect` to the end of the homepage URL \(Eg. [https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/connect](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ccs/connect)\).
