#Accessible YouTube Video Guide

When adding YouTube videos to your Drupal site, there are a few things to keep in mind. First and foremost, It is important to have accessible videos. 

An example of an accessible video:
```html
<div class="mb-20 embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="embed-responsive-item" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ODsGXtpUGs4" title="A message from incoming president, Dr. Charlotte Yates (video)" width="100%"></iframe></div>
   <p><a href="/node/57">Descriptive Transcript<span class="sr-only"> for a Message from incoming president, Dr. Charlotte Yates</span></a></p>
   <span class="h3">A Message from Incoming President, Dr. Charlotte Yates</span></div>
<hr class="mb-20" />
```
This code includes the title of the video in three places. The first place is as the title of the video in the <iframe> section, the second is as screen reader-only text as part of the link text for the descriptie transcript, and the last is as a heading that's visible on the screen.
Also note that there is a link to a descriptive transcript for the video. It is linked under the video and can be any accessible document, or a separate webpage (which is the easiest and most acessible option) designated to be used as the transcript. The transcript should be titled "Descriptive Transcript for <insert title of video here> Video"

##Some additional design options for videos are:

###Aspect Ratio
for a 16:9 aspect ratio:
```html
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..."></iframe>
</div>
```
for a 4:3 aspect ratio:
```html
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..."></iframe>
</div>
```

###Using the Spacer Classes
For the spacer classes, the naming format is {property}{sides}-{size}.

Where {property} is one of:

- m - for classes that set margin
- p - for classes that set padding
Where {sides} is one of:

- t - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top
- b - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom
- l - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left
- r - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right
- x - for classes that set both *-left and *-right
- y - for classes that set both *-top and *-bottom
- blank - for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element
Where {size} is one of:

- 10 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to 10px
- 15 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to 15px
- 20 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to 20px
- 40 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to 40px
So class="mt-40" sets the margin of an element to 40px.

##Bringing it all together

The given embed code from YouTube is:
```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/<video code>" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```
It is necessary to add
```html
class="embed-responsive-item" title="VIDEO TITLE (video)"
```
into the <iframe> area and 
```html
<p><a href="LINK TO TRANSCRIPT">Descriptive Transcript<span class="sr-only"> for VIDEO TITLE</span></a></p>
<span class="h3">VIDEO TITLE</span></div>
```
adjacent to the video code
