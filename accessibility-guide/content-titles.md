# Content Titles
As part of the UG Drupal platform, every content type you create requires a title in order for the content to be successfully created. This specific field for this is called 'Title.' It is important that this title is descriptive enough of what the content is about but not too long. The title is the first thing that is shown on each page and it gives the user a general understanding of what the content below is about. A simple example of a content title is the title at the top of a basic page.
