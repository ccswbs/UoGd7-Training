#Audio & Video

If you are using video or audio clips on a web page there are several criteria to consider, such as captioning and audio description of the video. Audio description is an extra track explaining what happens on the screen to visually impaired users. If you are not able to provide your videos with audio descriptions then give an alternative in the form of a transcript that is uploaded or linked to from the page. Be aware that without audio descriptions your site cannot be Level AA-compliant, only Level A-compliant. If the content is solely visual (no sound) or only audio (no visual) then a text version is an accepted alternative on both levels.

**/!\ Strong Recomendation**: The AODA Team strongly suggests that instead of embedding a YouTube video, a hyperlinked image of the video is provided with appropriate alt text.
