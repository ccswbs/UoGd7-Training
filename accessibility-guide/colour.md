##Contrast Requirements

The colour that is used in the text or image must have the correct contrast ratio.

    + **Small Text & Images**: Small-scale text and images of small-scale text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
    
    + **Large Text & Images**: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
    
    + **Incidental**: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content have no contrast requirement.
    
    + **Logotypes**: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

##Use of Colour for Meaning

Colour must not be used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. For example, a calendar that only shows what day it is by highlighting the day in green would fail the standard due to there being no other way of knowing what day it is other than through visual representation.
