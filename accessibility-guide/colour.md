#Colour

* [Contrast]
* [Use of Colour for Meaning]

Colour must not be used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. For example, a calendar that only shows what day it is by highlighting the day in green would fail the standard due to there being no other way of knowing what day it is other than through visual representation.
