##Accessible Links
When adding links to a page, ensure that the user can determine the destination of the link. Avoid using ambiguous terms like "click here," 
"more" or "this" for link text. Instead, use descriptive link text to help users with a screen reader understand the context and destination of the link. For example, instead of "Click Here" you can use "read more about this topic here."

When adding links to anchors in the text, ensure the anchor is selected by element ID and not by name.
