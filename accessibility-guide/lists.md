#Lists

When using a list of items make sure to use the function for this that is built into the editor in the CMS. This will ensure that accessible code is entered for lists. Avoid just making dots that
look like a list (such as asterisk, dash etc.).

**/!\ Strong Recomendation**: The AODA Team strongly suggests that items that appear to be in a list on the page are also placed in a list in the code. Example: A list of links under a heading can be placed in a list.

####Nesting Lists

![Nested lists example](/images/Nested list example.png)

If you have a main list that requires a nested sub-list, you can use the same list formatting commands you would use in MS Word. To start a nested list, press `Enter` or `Return` from the main list item, then press `Tab`. Once the nested sub-list is complete and you need to return to the main list, press `Enter` or `Return` twice.

To create a list that uses both numbered points and bullet points, start with a nested list like the one pictured above. Then, highlight the list items you would like to convert to numbered points or bullet points, and then select the appropriate list button.
