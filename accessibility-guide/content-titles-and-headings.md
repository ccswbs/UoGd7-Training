# Content Titles and Headings

##Titles
As part of the UG Drupal platform, every content type you create requires a title in order for the content to be successfully created. This specific field for this is called 'Title.' It is important that this title is descriptive enough of what the content is about but not too long. The title is the first thing that is shown on each page and it gives the user a general understanding of what the content below is about. A simple example of a content title is the title at the top of a basic page.

Page Titles will also appear in the tab in your browser.

##Headings
When writing text for web pages, consider the fact that some users cannot get an overview of a page visually, as opposed to structurally. Make sure that pages are divided into logical sections, each with a heading that is descriptive of the section. You can use several levels of headings: Heading 2, Heading 3, etc., so that assistive technologies can render them as headings.

**/!\ Strong Recomendation**: The AODA Team strongly suggests that headings be used in successive order. This means that any headings related to the Overall Page title (h1) start with h2 and then follow in order. Picture example below:
