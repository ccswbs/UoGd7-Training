#Tables

When using data tables with information, it is important to indicate headings for rows and/or columns. The way to do this is very CMS specific. In some cases the editor provides an accessibility tab where this information can be entered when using data tables.

**/!\ Strong Recomendation**: The AODA Team strongly suggests that tables are purely used for tabluar data and not for layout. If you require assistance in terms of layout, please speak with your Web Manager/Site Owner for assistance.
