# Documents

When uploading documents to your website it is important to ask yourself these questions:

1. Can the content be uploaded as a web page instead of a [document](https://www.uoguelph.ca/accessibility/web/what-fix/documents)?
2. Can you request an accessible version of the document prior to posting it online?
3. Have you reviewed the Office of Diversity and Human Rights' [Tipsheets on Document Accessibility](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/information-and-communication-document-accessibility)?
4. Have you visited the [Accessible Digital Office Document Project (ADOD)](http://adod.idrc.ocad.ca/) for additional guidance?

**/!\ Strong Recomendation**: The AODA Team strongly suggests that any information in a document that can be is uploaded as a basic webpage. This will provide users with the most accessible content.
