##Accessible Links
When adding links to a page, ensure that the user can determine the destination of the link. Avoid using ambiguous terms like "click here," "more" or "this" for link text. Instead, use descriptive link text to help users with a screen reader understand the context and destination of the link. For example, instead of "Click Here" you can use "read more about this topic here."

##Anchor Links

Anchor links are links that will take the user to a specific spot on the same page. 

###How to create anchor links

1. In the Drupal text editor, highlight some text to be used as the anchor (the spot the link will jump to). 
2. Select the anchor button (flag icon). This will open the Anchor Properties dialog box.
