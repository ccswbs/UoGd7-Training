# Multimedia Accessibility


## The University's position on web video is:
- We have lots of web accessibility problems, and we're prioritizing what we work on
- We have prioritized web video accessibility near the bottom of the list, and we will get to it someday, but right now we don't have a good solution

## For clients, this means you have choices:
- For a perfectly accessible website, you cannot embed videos until YouTube's flash version goes away.
- If you "image link" to YouTube, captions and transcripts are required.
- You can choose not to post videos at all
- You can choose to embed YouTube videos knowing your website will not be perfectly accessible, and you will have to get back to it someday, and there may be a cost to do so.
