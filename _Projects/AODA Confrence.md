# AODA Confrence 

## Introduction

Back in (2013) University recognized that there were number of website owners who did not have people or financial resources necessary to make their websites AODA compliant (History).

University asked CCS to make a proposal to help – or propose a solution in W14

AODA steering committee – high level governance around AODA 

We came up with a proposal to fund a 4 person team for 3 years

Idea was to port the existing websites to Drupal 7 websites so that we can use our accessible/responsive platform

University updated their homepage – which caused us to rebuild our theme from scratch.

4 person team is – 2 coop students, lead developer,  project manager
Tier one and tier two websites – plus student groups (SLAM groups – student government groups)

While all tier 1 and 2 sites are eligible – their participation is not mandatory , if they choose not to participate, they are responsible for their own AODA compliance 

We chose to prioritize the most important/visible/used websites – to determine tier 1 and 2 sites is the number of clicks from the homepage; we made some room for negotiation based upon perceived impact on sites

GOAL: To provide a solution to University affiliated website owners who do not have the capacity to comply with AODA 

When we really began S15, we tried working site-by-site, to understand how long it will take to deliver one

By F15 we were able to deliver 4 sites
Through this effort, we learned:
	- Each website takes a long time
	- In all cases, clients wanted the opportunity to make changes before going live
	- In some cases, clients want the opportunity to completely revamp their websites, or consolidate several into one

All this makes intuitive sense, but our project wasn’t set up to meet these needs in the 3-year timeline

We adjusted, we’ve created a model and process to solve these problems
	- We transitioned to a more agile development process, using “sprints” to deliver working functionality every 2 weeks (SCRUM)
	- We created and are evolving an automated site migration platform – this allows us to auotmatically migrate website content from client’s existing production sites into our development environment repeatedly
	- We provided development and staging sites to clients as part of this automated platform – this allows clients to make all the changes they want without slowing us down. We’ll just continue to migrate automatically over time until clients are ready for the final push to go live
	- We are standardizing our feature set to be as efficient as possible – this has slowed our ability to launch sites so far, but enables us to do more, faster in the rest of years 2 & 3
	- We augmented our team using gov’t funded internships, this enabled us to accomplish what I’ve already described, and also to put extra effort into developing our training and workshops
	- Through these efforts, we’re better equipping clients to take care of website accessibility going forward
	- All this has created a community of engaged website owners and content developers, which we hope sets the University up for future success

## Drupal 7 Platform

One other challenge we faced over the last year, was meeting the expectations of the community after the refreshed campus homepage launched in June 2015
Our original project plan assumed the use of the 2014 “theme” e.g. www.uoguelph.ca/hr
The refreshed homepage is great, and our clients wanted it
We took the time to update our Drupal platform to align closely with the new look, but this did slow us down a bit

Created in order to WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards
To assist our clients in creating websites that are compliant to the WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards.
Aim to create consistent unified branding throughout University of Guelph’s websites.


## Client Engagement
## Challenges + Successes

Prioritization:
Tier 1 vs. tier 2 vs. platform readiness
e.g. College of Arts prioritizes departmental websites higher than college

Balancing non-participant needs - e.g. Office of Research

Optics - They’ve chosen to opt out, and they get the new homepage look faster than many

Communication
We’re probably not communicating enough
Workshop instructors created a slideshow to address part of  miscommunication

Custom Features
E.g. Award winning 140 Faces: https://www.uoguelph.ca/oac/140faces
Tension between getting the platform done and sites launched, and custom functionality that benefits the few instead of the many

Timeline/Funding/Team
Unclear start & end dates – we’re going with September 1st  2014 – August 31st 2017 – are we on the same page?

Team staffing
Hiring started when funding was released, team actually formed in January 2015
3rd project manager, 6&7th coop students – turnover!

Actual costs for the project team are higher than projected - CCS eating the difference
e.g. professional services PM


The gov’t funded internships augmented our team, and have really helped speed things up. We will be applying for this funding again in 2016, and looking for other similar ways to augment the team

While the partnership with UofG’s Coop program leads to natural project team turnover, it’s been a great way to staff the team at a reasonable price. There is a delay in productivity when new staff come onboard and play catch up. However In turn we’re providing students with skills and experiences that are relevant and marketable. Although the positions have become more technical over the last few months, we’ve hired students from a variety of disciplines, including Adult Development, Child Youth & Family, and of course Computer Science and Software Engineering.

The S15 decision to create a refreshed Drupal theme has worked out great. The websites we’re working on look great and the feedback from clients has been very positive. The decision enabled the University to react quickly to relaunch two high profile websites in F15, aligning them with the look and feel of the campus homepage.

I’ve already touched on the SCRUM process and the automated migration platform – we’re very very pleased with how they’re working out, and with how they’ve enabled us to kick things into high gear.


## Future Outlook

* Where we are now and where we plan to go.
* What is our current status with the project?
* How many sites and clients have we brought live?
* Where do we need to go next? What is the next big push?
