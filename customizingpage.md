### Categorizing view panes:

Taxonomy is used to categorize content so it is visible in desired locations. If you would like to categorize your view pane by using taxonomy:

1. Ensure the content type has a category
2. Note down the **term number** that the category is associated with. The **term number** is located in the url on your screen (ex. https://.../term/109/...)
3. Add the **term number** to the `Category` space, when configuring your view pane.
4. Select `Finish`

*Always `save` the page when you are done customizing.*
