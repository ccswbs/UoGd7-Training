#File Attachments

When you add a new Basic Page to your *Drupal* website, scroll down, and beneath the body section is a file attachments option. This tool is used for uploading a variety of media, including documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and images. 

##How to Attach Files

When creating or editing a Basic Page, simply click "choose file" and select the file you would like to attach to your page. Then, click "upload."



##Linking to Attached Files

If you would like to create a link to a file on your webpage, the AODA Remediation Team recommends attaching the file to the page first. 

1. Once your file is attached, scroll back up to the "body" section of the page.
2. Locate the piece of text you would like to use for your link text and highlight it. 
3. With the link text highlighted, click the "link" button. 
4. From the dropdown menu for link type, select "URL."
5. With the file opened in a new tab, copy the **path** and paste it into the URL field in the *Druapl* link dialog. Hit "OK."
6. Scroll to the bottom of the editing page and hit "Save." 

Note: use relative links (copy the path only)
