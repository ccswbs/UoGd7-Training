#File Attachments

When you add a new Basic Page to your *Drupal* website, scroll down, and beneath the body section is a file attachments option. This tool is used for uploading a variety of media, including documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and images. 

##How to Attach Files

When creating or editing a Basic Page, simply click "choose file" and select the file you would like to attach to your page. Then, click "upload."



##Linking to Attached Files

If you would like to create a link to a file on your webpage, the AODA Remediation Team recommends attaching the file to the page first. Once it is attached, scroll back up to the "body" section of the page.
