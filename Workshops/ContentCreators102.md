Accessibility, The AODA, and WCAG 2.0
-------------------------------------

Accessible design is good for all. Large public-sector organizations
usually have large, multi-page, multi-department—and often
cumbersome—websites. Accessible design and the principles of universal
design, with their emphasis on clear, streamlined and flexible
presentation, content and navigation, can lessen the frustrations of
users who use your website. An accessible website is beneficial to all
users and certainly to the organizations that create them because it
means their website is better able to reach all members of its target
audience.

**The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA)**
became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the
Government of Ontario has developed mandatory accessibility standards
that identifies, removes, and prevents barriers for people with
disabilities. Disability impacts the lives of many Ontarians, and the
numbers of people with disabilities is increasing. Today, 15.5% of
Ontario’s population has a disability and this number will continue to
grow as the population ages.

The AODA requires that beginning January 1, 2014, new public websites,
significantly refreshed websites and any web content posted after
January 1, 2012 must meet **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
2.0 Level A**. And beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and
web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **WCAG 2.0 Level
AA**. WCAG 2.0 is an internationally accepted standard for web
accessibility developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**, an
international team of experts. Following these guidelines should make it
easier for everyone to access your website and content.

WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles:
Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. For each guideline,
there are testable success criteria, which are ranked at 3 levels: A,
AA, AAA.

Governance
----------

### Roles and Responsibilities

There are three main roles we have implemented with our CMS: Site
Managers and Content Authors and Content Editors.

**Site Managers:** Can edit and manage users, basic site layout,
changing view categories, Titles, and number of items to display,
creation of menus, and configuration of site specific taxonomies. The
role of a site manager is to ensure AODA compliancy and to monitor for
any broken links and misspellings using SiteImprove. We recommend that
there only be 1-2 Site Managers to ensure that site maintenance and
conformity to WCAG 2.0 Standards is retained and that the ability to
divide up responsibility is easier to achieve and enforce.

**Content Authors / Editors:** Can create and edit content types such as
Banners, Events, Basic Pages, News Articles, and others. There are two
types of Content Creators: **Authors** and **Editors**.

-   Authors can create, edit, and publish/unpublish their own content.

-   Editors can create, edit, and publish/unpublish their own content,
    as well as edit and unpublish content created by other users.

### Site Managers

If you have the responsibility of ensuring accessibility on a website,
then all the criteria in WCAG are relevant to you (usually on level AA).
It is then necessary to have a fundamental understanding of the subject
in order to be able to ensure content conforms to the guidelines. It is
also important that you communicate and train your web editors &
colleagues on how to publish content the ‘accessible way.’ This way,
when content is added it furthers your site’s accessibility rather than
introducing new accessibility issues. Start out by using tools that can
assist you in getting a quick overview of issues. For large websites the
effort most likely needs to be prioritized.

*The following steps will help you to get started as a site manager:*

#### Learn About The AODA and Content Editing Standards.

**AODA Standards** – effective January 2014 website content changes must
comply with provincial legislation known as the **Accessibility for
Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**. The Standards governing
websites is called the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
2.0** *Level A* compliance was required in 2014 and *Level AA*
compliance is required by 2021. This documentation has some information
at the beginning of Chapter 2 to help get you started. You should also
visit the [U of G Web Accessibility
site](https://www.uoguelph.ca/accessibility/web/) for additional help
and resources.

#### Document Accessibility

Providing documents in a range of formats will enable people with
different abilities and learning styles to choose the format that works
best for them.

Word documents and PDFs uploaded to your website must be formatted and
edited adequately for accessibility. The University of Guelph’s
**Diversity and Human Rights (DHR)** department has a [web page
dedicated to helping you create accessible
documents](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/information-and-communication-document-accessibility).

It is recommended that clients go through their content and ensure their
documents are WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.

#### Register for a SiteImprove Web Accessibility Course

[The Siteimprove website application](http://siteimprove.com/) is used
for tracking technical compliance - for user training **Contact
Diversity & Human Rights**. Visit SiteImprove Academy to register for a
SiteImprove web accessibility certification course. These courses are
free for anyone from the University of Guelph. The non-technical
certification is for content contributors, managers, marketing and other
members of your organization who participate in the decision-making for
your web sites. For more information or to register for this course,
visit the course description page for the Non-Technical Accessibility
Course.

#### Monitor your Website for Accessibility Issues

The University of Guelph monitors the accessibility of its websites
using an online web governance service called SiteImprove. Once a site
is added to SiteImprove, the service will check the site for
accessibility issues, broken links, and spelling mistakes that can be
found through automated means. If you would like to monitor your
University of Guelph website using SiteImprove, contact the University
of [Guelph AODA Web team](aodaweb@uoguelph.ca). Be ready to provide the
URL of the website you wish to monitor and the name of the department
associated with the website.

### Scoping and Prioritization

The following things should be thought about as you transition into AODA
Remediation Team’s Platform:

1.  Create an inventory of content.
2.  Scoping and Prioritization.
3.  Workflows

#### Web Inventory

Take stock and create an inventory of the department’s public-facing
websites and Web applications.

Taking stock of the department’s public-facing websites and Web
applications is the essential first step in implementing the Standard on
Web Accessibility. The creation of a Web inventory enables Site Managers
to have the information they need to make strategic decisions to improve
the accessibility of information and services on their department’s
public-facing sites.

#### Scoping and prioritizing websites and Web applications

Once the Web inventory report has been developed:

**Scoping:** Determine which Web pages are redundant, outdated, and
trivial (ROT), and ensure their removal from the department’s websites;
identify and archive online or offline Web pages of websites and Web
applications that can be archived.

**Prioritization:** The AODA remediation team we will be providing an
accessibility report once your site has been migrated over to the new
platform. The report will highlight any changes that might need to be
made with your existing content. Newly created content should be given
prioritization. Legacy (content posted before Jan 1, 2012) content
corrections should be phased throughout your process.

#### Workflow Suggestions

We have created different roles to help facilitate a new type of
workflow. Authors, Editors, Site Managers.

-   Authors can create their own content - &gt; give this responsibility
    to anyone who will be contributing content.
-   Editors should comb the content, make edits and
    publish/unpublish content.
-   Site managers should constantly monitor through various tools like
    SiteImprove to ensure the content that has been published has no
    misspellings, broken links, appropriate alt tags and colour contrast
    for images, etc.

Best Practices
--------------

The best way to begin is to start small and work towards harder
criteria. [SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com) will help highlight
and create reports of where your website needs improvement.

#### 1. Start with the basics – Broken Links

Broken links negatively affect users perception of your website, yet all
too often it is the basics like this that are overlooked. There should
be no broken links on your website.

#### 2. 150 characters or less for metadata.

Keep it short. Metadata includes things like Alt descriptions,
summaries, and other descriptive text. Meta descriptions are commonly
used on search engine result pages (SERPs) to display preview snippets
for a given page. Ideally, Meta descriptions should be no more than 150
characters or else you risk important information being cut or to long
to be useful.

#### 3. Keep it small

As a general rule of thumb, documents and files should not be bigger
than 10MB otherwise they will cause a range of annoying problems for the
user. They will slow the speed of your site, cause problems if you have
a responsive design and put a serious dent in mobile users data plans.

#### 4. Link it right

Website link texts can be problematic. The outcome is often that people
revert to using ‘read more’ or ‘click here’, which are not only
inaccessible to a number of users but also make no sense when taken out
of context.

#### 5. Testing 1, 2, 3

Use SiteImprove to help in assisting and finding accessibility issues
such as broken links, misspellings, and WCAG 2.0 Accessibility testing.

Accessibility Top 5
-------------------

The following items should be learned and affixed for Content Creators
and Site Managers. As content creators and managers, you will not
necessarily need to know all the WCAG 2.0 details. The following list is
something however we should all be familiar with:

### 1. Text for everyone

-   Make sure all text can be highlighted and read aloud so that screen
    readers and reading tools can access them.
-   Avoid images of text where possible. Where not, make sure that text
    alternatives are equivalent.
-   Provide alternative text for images. These must reflect the purpose
    of the image:
-   Decorative: no alternative text.
-   Having a function: Describe the functionality.
-   Linking: Describe destination

### 2. Versatility

Create a website that can be used by as many as possible, in as many
ways as possible according to user needs.

-   All functionality can be used without a mouse – from the
    keyboard alone.
-   All functionality can be used with a mouse.
-   Users can adapt color and font according to specific needs.
-   Ensure none of your content will cause seizures - **avoid** rapidly
    flashing content.

### 3. Association

-   Text, headings, buttons, fields etc. that are logically connected
    must also be visually connected.
-   Make sure not to give instructions based solely on a location of
    content, such as ‘In the box to your right’. Supplement with a
    heading as well.
-   Make link texts that can be read out of context. Avoid ‘Click here’,
    ‘Read more’.

### 4. Color for everyone

-   Make sure that the color of the background and the color of the text
    are sufficient contrast to each other. That way people with low
    vision can also read it.
-   Make sure that you do not give information by use of color alone,
    such as saying “In the green box you will find”. Otherwise it can
    create problems for both users with low vision or no vision, or
    people with color blindness.

### 5. Robustness

-   Have a consistent design throughout the website.
-   Follow known website conventions.
-   Follow the standard for the format you are publishing in (for
    example HTML 5 syntax) - this will optimize your website for many
    different platforms and user agents.

Siteimprove Guidelines
----------------------

In this section, we will discuss about:

1.  Siteimprove access and how to get it.
2.  What Siteimprove does and how to navigate its basic features.
3.  How to fix spelling mistakes and broken links.
4.  Briefly talk about the accessibility tab and accessible
    document creation.

### Getting Access to SiteImprove

If you are a web content owner, you should have already received your
SiteImprove credentials. If not, [contact Diversity & Human
Rights](http://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/) and they can add
you to the list and give you access to the system for your content site
area.

### What is SiteImprove Quality Assurance?

-   SiteImprove is a service that regularly crawls your organizational
    website and tracks any broken links, spelling errors, and
    accessibility issues.
-   Fixing any spelling or link errors reported by SiteImprove requires
    the user to edit a page within the University of Guelph’s content
    management system, Drupal 7.
-   SiteImprove does NOT affect or edit pages within any site.
-   Users can [login to the SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com/) to
    view detailed information about their departments site.
-   SiteImprove can email users every five (5) days with a report on
    a site.
-   Users who maintain multiple sites can view a report on each of those
    specific sites by selecting the appropriate Group from the dropdown
    menu at the top of the dashboard titled “Choose a site”.
-   SiteImprove does rank pages on the number of errors based on a scale
    of 0-10 (10 is best).

### Introduction to SiteImprove Quality Assurance

Once logged into SiteImprove, you will have access to a customized
dashboard reflecting the report of your specific site. If you maintain
or have access to multiple sites, those sites are listed under the Group
drop down menu.

SiteImprove Quality Assurance is composed of four modules:

-   QA Overview – provides an overall view of a site’s health,
    highlighting broken links and misspellings that affect the
    most pages.
-   Links – specific details concerning pages with broken links such as
    frequent broken links, external links, etc.
-   Spelling – specific details concerning the misspellings located
    across your site.
-   Inventory – provides information regarding quantity and types of
    documents available on your site along with information regarding
    phone numbers, email addresses, media, etc.

SiteImprove Quality Assurance also comes bundled with an Accessibility
tab for viewing your site’s compliance to WCAG 2.0 standards. Please
note that SiteImprove Quality Assurance reports are based on the most
recent site scan and may not reflect any recently published changes. You
can initiate a rescan of any page at any time by clicking the button
labeled `rescan`.

### Correcting Spelling Mistakes

-   In order to look at spelling mistakes specifically, you can click on
    the number within the Misspellings button within the dashboard. You
    can also access the misspelling page using the navigation menu,
    under spelling.
-   This will take you to a page which lists all the misspellings on
    this section of the website.
-   To see which page a particular spelling mistake is on, you can click
    on the magnifying glass.
-   This will then open a new tab and take you to a page highlighting
    your spelling mistakes within the body text in red. Misspellings and
    Potential Misspellings are listed on the menu to the left.

#### Potential Misspellings

Potential misspellings are words that SiteImprove does not recognize,
and will need review. To review a potential misspelling do the
following:

1.  Click on it and a menu will open with suggestions and other options.
2.  You can either confirm the misspelling - in which case it becomes
    highlighted in red and registered as a misspelling on the
    `Quality Assurance` pane - Ignore it (in the case of foreign
    language words) or add it to the dictionary - in which case the
    potential misspelling will disappear and any other instances of this
    word will stop being registered as potential misspellings.

#### Fixing Misspellings

-   In order to fix a misspelling, you will need to log into your
    website and navigate to the page where the misspelling is located
    and fix it manually.
-   After you have made the necessary change, you can go back to the
    page within SiteImprove and click on the `Recheck Page` button in
    the top left of the page.

### Fixing a Broken Link

1.  Log in as usual and pick your site to get to the overview page, and
    then click on the number within the “Broken Links” circle.
2.  The next page outlines all of the broken links in your site. Take
    note of the column to the right of this called “pages”. This tells
    you on how many pages this particular link is found (and broken) on.
3.  In order to see which pages a link is broken on, you can hover over
    the box with the number of pages in it and a “+” will appear. Click
    this to expand the box and it will list all of the pages in which
    this broken link can be found.
4.  Clicking on one of the results will then open a page report in a new
    tab and show you where on the page the broken link is.
5.  You will need to log into your Drupal Website and fix the broken
    link in the editor. Then, when the link is fixed you can click the
    `recheck` button/option the page and update Siteimprove.
