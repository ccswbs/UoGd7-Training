## Accessibility, The AODA, and WCAG 2.0
Accessible design is good for all. Large public-sector organizations usually have large, multi-page, multi-department—and often cumbersome—websites. Accessible design and the principles of universal design, with their emphasis on clear, streamlined and flexible presentation, content and navigation, can lessen the frustrations of users who use your website. An accessible website is beneficial to all users and certainly to the organizations that create them because it means their website is better able to reach all members of its target audience.

**The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA)** became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the Government of Ontario has developed mandatory accessibility standards that identifies, removes, and prevents barriers for people with disabilities. Disability impacts the lives of many Ontarians, and the numbers of people with disabilities is increasing. Today, 15.5% of Ontario’s population has a disability and this number will continue to grow as the population ages.

The AODA requires that beginning January 1, 2014, new public websites, significantly refreshed websites and any web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A**. And beginning January 1, 2021, all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet **WCAG 2.0 Level AA**. WCAG 2.0 is an internationally accepted standard for web accessibility developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**, an international team of experts. Following these guidelines should make it easier for everyone to access your website and content.

WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are ranked at 3 levels: A, AA, AAA.

## Governance

### Roles and Responsibilities
There are three main roles we have implemented with our CMS: Site Managers and Content Authors and Content Editors.

**Site Managers:** Can edit and manage users, basic site layout, changing view categories, Titles, and number of items to display, creation of menus, and configuration of site specific taxonomies. The role of a site manager is to ensure AODA compliancy and to monitor for any broken links and misspellings using SiteImprove. We recommend that there only be 1-2 Site Managers to ensure that site maintenance and conformity to WCAG 2.0 Standards is retained and that the ability to divide up responsibility is easier to achieve and enforce.

**Content Authors / Editors:** Can create and edit content types such as Banners, Events, Basic Pages, News Articles, and others. There are two types of Content Creators: **Authors** and **Editors**.

- Authors can create, edit, and publish/unpublish their own content.

- Editors can create, edit, and publish/unpublish their own content, as well as edit and unpublish content created by other users.

### Site Managers
If you have the responsibility of ensuring accessibility on a website, then all the criteria in WCAG are relevant to you (usually on level AA). It is then necessary to have a fundamental understanding of the subject in order to be able to ensure content conforms to the guidelines. It is also important that you communicate and train your web editors & colleagues on how to publish content the ‘accessible way.’ This way, when content is added it furthers your site’s accessibility rather than introducing new accessibility issues. Start out by using tools that can assist you in getting a quick overview of issues. For large websites the effort most likely needs to be prioritized.

*The following steps will help you to get started as a site manager:*

#### Learn About The AODA and Content Editing Standards.
**AODA Standards** – effective January 2014 website content changes must comply with provincial legislation known as the **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)**. The Standards governing websites is called the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0** *Level A* compliance was required in 2014 and *Level AA* compliance is required by 2021. This documentation has some information at the beginning of Chapter 2 to help get you started. You should also visit the [U of G Web Accessibility site](https://www.uoguelph.ca/accessibility/web/) for additional help and resources.

#### Document Accessibility
Providing documents in a range of formats will enable people with different abilities and learning styles to choose the format that works best for them.

Word documents and PDFs uploaded to your website must be formatted and edited adequately for accessibility. The University of Guelph's **Diversity and Human Rights (DHR)** department has a [web page dedicated to helping you create accessible documents](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/information-and-communication-document-accessibility).

It is recommended that clients go through their content and ensure their documents are WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.

#### Register for a SiteImprove Web Accessibility Course
[The Siteimprove website application](http://siteimprove.com/) is used for tracking technical compliance - for user training **Contact Diversity & Human Rights**.
Visit SiteImprove Academy to register for a SiteImprove web accessibility certification course. These courses are free for anyone from the University of Guelph. The non-technical certification is for content contributors, managers, marketing and other members of your organization who participate in the decision-making for your web sites. For more information or to register for this course, visit the course description page for the Non-Technical Accessibility Course.

#### Monitor your Website for Accessibility Issues
The University of Guelph monitors the accessibility of its websites using an online web governance service called SiteImprove. Once a site is added to SiteImprove, the service will check the site for accessibility issues, broken links, and spelling mistakes that can be found through automated means. If you would like to monitor your University of Guelph website using SiteImprove, contact the University of [Guelph AODA Web team](aodaweb@uoguelph.ca). Be ready to provide the URL of the website you wish to monitor and the name of the department associated with the website.


### Scoping and Prioritization
The following things should be thought about as you transition into AODA Remediation Team's Platform:

1. Create an inventory of content.
2. Scoping and Prioritization.
3. Workflows

#### Web Inventory
Take stock and create an inventory of the department’s public-facing websites and Web applications.

Taking stock of the department’s public-facing websites and Web applications is the essential first step in implementing the Standard on Web Accessibility. The creation of a Web inventory enables Site Managers to have the information they need to make strategic decisions to improve the accessibility of information and services on their department’s public-facing sites.

#### Scoping and prioritizing websites and Web applications

Once the Web inventory report has been developed:

**Scoping:** Determine which Web pages are redundant, outdated, and trivial (ROT), and ensure their removal from the department’s websites; identify and archive online or offline Web pages of websites and Web applications that can be archived.

**Prioritization:** The AODA remediation team we will be providing an accessibility report once your site has been migrated over to the new platform. The report will highlight any changes that might need to be made with your existing content. Newly created content should be given prioritization. Legacy (content posted before Jan 1, 2012) content corrections should be phased throughout your process.

#### Workflow Suggestions
We have created different roles to help facilitate a new type of workflow. Authors, Editors, Site Managers.

* Authors can create their own content - > give this responsibility to anyone who will be contributing content.
* Editors should comb the content, make edits and publish/unpublish content.
* Site managers should constantly monitor through various tools like SiteImprove to ensure the content that has been published has no misspellings, broken links, appropriate alt tags and colour contrast for images, etc.

## Best Practices

The best way to begin is to start small and work towards harder criteria. [SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com) will help highlight and create reports of where your website needs improvement.

#### 1. Start with the basics – Broken Links
Broken links negatively affect users perception of your website, yet all too often it is the basics like this that are overlooked. There should be no broken links on your website.

#### 2. 150 characters or less for metadata.
Keep it short. Metadata includes things like Alt descriptions, summaries, and other descriptive text. Meta descriptions are commonly used on search engine result pages (SERPs) to display preview snippets for a given page. Ideally, Meta descriptions should be no more than 150 characters or else you risk important information being cut or to long to be useful.

#### 3. Keep it small
As a general rule of thumb, documents and files should not be bigger than 10MB otherwise they will cause a range of annoying problems for the user. They will slow the speed of your site, cause problems if you have a responsive design and put a serious dent in mobile users data plans.

#### 4. Link it right
Website link texts can be problematic. The outcome is often that people revert to using ‘read more’ or ‘click here’, which are not only inaccessible to a number of users but also make no sense when taken out of context.

#### 5. Testing 1, 2, 3
Use SiteImprove to help in assisting and finding accessibility issues such as broken links, misspellings, and WCAG 2.0 Accessibility testing.

## Accessibility Top 5
The following items should be learned and affixed for Content Creators and Site Managers. As content creators and managers, you will not necessarily need to know all the WCAG 2.0 details.
The following list is something however we should all be familiar with:

### 1. Text for everyone
* Make sure all text can be highlighted and read aloud so that screen readers and reading tools can access them.
* Avoid images of text where possible. Where not, make sure that text alternatives are equivalent.
* Provide alternative text for images. These must reflect the purpose of the image:
   * Decorative: no alternative text.
   * Having a function: Describe the functionality.
   * Linking: Describe destination

### 2. Versatility
Create a website that can be used by as many as possible, in as many ways as possible according to user needs.

* All functionality can be used without a mouse – from the keyboard alone.
* All functionality can be used with a mouse.
* Users can adapt color and font according to specific needs.
* Ensure none of your content will cause seizures - **avoid** rapidly flashing content.

### 3. Association
* Text, headings, buttons, fields etc. that are logically connected must also be visually connected.
* Make sure not to give instructions based solely on a location of content, such as ‘In the box to your right’. Supplement with a heading as well.
* Make link texts that can be read out of context. Avoid ‘Click here’, ‘Read more’.

### 4. Color for everyone
* Make sure that the color of the background and the color of the text are sufficient contrast to each other. That way people with low vision can also read it.
* Make sure that you do not give information by use of color alone, such as saying "In the green box you will find". Otherwise it can create problems for both users with low vision or no vision, or people with color blindness.

### 5. Robustness
* Have a consistent design throughout the website.
* Follow known website conventions.
* Follow the standard for the format you are publishing in (for example HTML 5 syntax) - this will optimize your website for many different platforms and user agents.

## Siteimprove Guidelines
In this section, we will discuss about:

1. Siteimprove access and how to get it.
2. What Siteimprove does and how to navigate its basic features.
3. How to fix spelling mistakes and broken links.
4. Briefly talk about the accessibility tab and accessible document creation.

### Getting Access to SiteImprove
If you are a web content owner, you should have already received your SiteImprove credentials. If not, [contact Diversity & Human Rights](http://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/) and they can add you to the list and give you access to the system for your content site area.

### What is SiteImprove Quality Assurance?
* SiteImprove is a service that regularly crawls your organizational website and tracks any broken links, spelling errors, and accessibility issues.
* Fixing any spelling or link errors reported by SiteImprove requires the user to edit a page within the University of Guelph's content management system, Drupal 7.
* SiteImprove does NOT affect or edit pages within any site.
* Users can [login to the SiteImprove](http://my.siteimprove.com/) to view detailed information about their departments site.
* SiteImprove can email users every five (5) days with a report on a site.
* Users who maintain multiple sites can view a report on each of those specific sites by selecting the appropriate Group from the dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard titled "Choose a site".
* SiteImprove does rank pages on the number of errors based on a scale of 0-10 (10 is best).

### Introduction to SiteImprove Quality Assurance

Once logged into SiteImprove, you will have access to a customized dashboard reflecting the report of your specific site. If you maintain or have access to multiple sites, those sites are listed under the Group drop down menu.

SiteImprove Quality Assurance is composed of four modules:

* QA Overview – provides an overall view of a site's health, highlighting broken links and misspellings that affect the most pages.
* Links – specific details concerning pages with broken links such as frequent broken links, external links, etc.
* Spelling – specific details concerning the misspellings located across your site.
* Inventory – provides information regarding quantity and types of documents available on your site along with information regarding phone numbers, email addresses, media, etc.

SiteImprove Quality Assurance also comes bundled with an Accessibility tab for viewing your site’s compliance to WCAG 2.0 standards.
Please note that SiteImprove Quality Assurance reports are based on the most recent site scan and may not reflect any recently published changes. You can initiate a rescan of any page at any time by clicking the button labeled `rescan`.

### Correcting Spelling Mistakes
* In order to look at spelling mistakes specifically, you can click on the number within the Misspellings button within the dashboard. You can also access the misspelling page using the navigation menu, under spelling.
* This will take you to a page which lists all the misspellings on this section of the website.
* To see which page a particular spelling mistake is on, you can click on the magnifying glass.
* This will then open a new tab and take you to a page highlighting your spelling mistakes within the body text in red. Misspellings and Potential Misspellings are listed on the menu to the left.

#### Potential Misspellings
Potential misspellings are words that SiteImprove does not recognize, and will need review. To review a potential misspelling do the following:

1. Click on it and a menu will open with suggestions and other options.
2. You can either confirm the misspelling - in which case it becomes highlighted in red and registered as a misspelling on the `Quality Assurance` pane - Ignore it (in the case of foreign language words) or add it to the dictionary - in which case the potential misspelling will disappear and any other instances of this word will stop being registered as potential misspellings.

#### Fixing Misspellings
* In order to fix a misspelling, you will need to log into your website and navigate to the page where the misspelling is located and fix it manually.
* After you have made the necessary change, you can go back to the page within SiteImprove and click on the `Recheck Page` button in the top left of the page.

### Fixing a Broken Link
1. Log in as usual and pick your site to get to the overview page, and then click on the number within the “Broken Links” circle.
2. The next page outlines all of the broken links in your site. Take note of the column to the right of this called “pages”. This tells you on how many pages this particular link is found (and broken) on.
3. In order to see which pages a link is broken on, you can hover over the box with the number of pages in it and a “+” will appear. Click this to expand the box and it will list all of the pages in which this broken link can be found.
4. Clicking on one of the results will then open a page report in a new tab and show you where on the page the broken link is.
5. You will need to log into your Drupal Website and fix the broken link in the editor. Then, when the link is fixed you can click the `recheck` button/option the page and update Siteimprove.
