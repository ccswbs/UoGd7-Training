# Teaser Lists

Teaser lists are a type of view pane. You can add them to your site using the "customize this page" button, which is only available to those with site manager permissions. You may want to use teaser lists on the front page of your site to engage users.

Examples of teaser lists include "upcoming events" and "news." These lists will automatically update with the most relevant content. For news teaser lists, the most recent news items will appear at the top of the list. For events teaser lists, events are listed by date, with the soonest event at the top of the list.
