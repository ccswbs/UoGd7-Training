# Customizing Site Search

The following are two different options for placement of a Search Box form on your website.

## Option 1: Placing Search Box Using Customize this page

Search box is placed on the right-hand side of the page using **Customize this page.**

**Note:** Edits made using "Customize this page" will affect all pages of the same content type. \(E.g., An edit made to an Event page will affect all event pages on the site\)

1. Navigate to any Basic Page on your website. 
2. Select `Customize this page` at the middle-bottom of the page
3. The page has been broken down into sections. Scroll down until you reach “Right Side”

2. Select `Save` at the middle-bottom of the page

## Option 2: Link to Search Added to Main Menu Bar

A link is added to the Main Menu Bar that takes the user to the Search page.
