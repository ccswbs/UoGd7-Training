## Basic Github Workflow Guidelines
* The Documentation Team takes note when a new feature is being developed / getting ready for testing.
* Create a new issue to track the feature and discuss.
* When ready, open a pull / fork to start iterating on the content.
* When the content is in a good place, @mention the doc team and have a peer editor review the content and edits.
* When the feature is ready to go to their master, merge the pull request into the documentation master. GitBooks will update automatically unless it is a new article, in which point a link will be made to the doc in gitbooks.
* Update book the module on the CCS Website to keep it up to date.
