## What is Drupal?
### A Brief Description
Websites are often thought of as a collection of static pages, perhaps with some functions like a blog or a comments section. Site managers often think of their site in terms of a tree-like hierarchy of pages that they will edit.

**The University of Guelph Business Web & Development Solutions** department uses a **Content Management System** (CMS) called **Drupal**. Drupal, unlike traditional websites, treats most [Content Types](Drupal_Features_Terms_Acroynms.md#content-type) as variations on the same concept: a *Node* (more on this in a moment). Static pages, blog posts, and news items (some possible node types) are all stored in the same way, and the site's navigation structure is designed separately by editing menus, views (lists of content), and blocks.

## Where to Start?
A lot can be accomplished through exploration of the Drupal interface. Exploring the Drupal interface is probably the best way to learn how to use Drupal. Along with exploration, it is encouraged that you read the differenst sections of this documentation as many of the frequently asked questions have been answered and explained along with detailed documentation of the numerous content types associated with the Drupal platform that we provide.

## Contributing to the Training Module

The University of Guelph Business Web & Development Solutions department strives to provide top notch documentation to users. In order to help us improve this documentation you can submit an email to ccs-websolutions@uoguelph.ca with your feedback. 

Alternatively, if you want to directly contribute to this module, you have a few options:

2. Subscribe to the repository and review new updates as they come in
3. Contact CCS Web Business Solutions

### Basic Github Workflow Guidelines
* The Documentation Team takes note when a new feature is being developed/prepared for testing.
* Create a new issue to track the feature and discuss.
* When ready, open a pull/fork to start iterating on the content.
* When the content is in a good place, @mention the doc team and have a peer editor review the content and edits.
* When the feature is ready to go to its master, merge the pull request into the documentation master. GitBooks will update automatically unless it is a new article, in which case a link will be made to the doc in GitBooks.
* Update book the module on the CCS Website to keep it up to date.
