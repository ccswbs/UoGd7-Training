# Guide to Google Analytics

## What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a free service that collects and reports information
on users of your website.

## Getting Access to Google Analytics

Logging in to Google Analytics requires a Google account. You may use
an existing Google account (such as a Gmail account) or create one for
the purpose of accessing the analytics service.

If you are a web site manager, you may already have access to analytics
for your site. If not, contact CCS Web Solutions with your Google account
and they can add you to the list.

## Configuring the Google Analytics Module

The Google Analytics module for Drupal allows your site to be tracked
by Google Analytics by adding a Javascript tracking code to every page.

> configure the Google Analytics module for you when your site is
> launched. Only attempt to configure the Google Analytics module
> with your tracking ID if you host the site yourself.

1. Log in to your site as administrator.

2. Go to Administration >> Configuration >> System >> Google Analytics
   (admin/config/system/googleanalytics).

3. Enter your Web Property ID.

4. Click `Save Configuration`.
