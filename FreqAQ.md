# Frequently Asked Questions
## 1. What is considered to be a University of Guelph website?

The Communications & Public Affairs (C&PA) department provides official [web design guidelines](http://www.uoguelph.ca/web/styleguide/) and [web publishing guidelines](http://www.uoguelph.ca/web/publishing/) which can help you identify whether your website is a University of Guelph website. Some of the criteria which help identify a University of Guelph website are:

* A website that bears the [University of Guelph identifier](http://www.uoguelph.ca/web/styleguide/#identifier).
* A website with a URL that falls under a “uoguelph.ca” domain
* A website that is copyrighted by the University of Guelph
* A website that is directly controlled by the University of Guelph

If you are unsure whether your website is a University of Guelph website, [contact the AODA Web Team by email](aodaweb@uoguelph.ca) for guidance.

## 2. Is there a limit in creating new revisions?

No. There is no limit to the number of revisions a node can have. A new revision is created every time the "Save" button is selected.

## 3. How small can the images be?

Here are the recommended image sizes for the following features:
**Banners:** The recommended image size is 1140 x 292 pixels.
**Event Featured Image:** Images must be between 200x160 and 1140x570 pixels.
**Featured Items:** Images must be between 380x200 and 1140x570 pixels.
**News Featured Image:** Images must be between 640x240 and 1140x570 pixels.

## 4. Why can I not see the layout options?

Only SiteManagers can see layout options. If you are unable to see layout options that might mean the proper rights have not been given to you. To remediate this contact your SiteManager or the AODA Remediation Team to get the proper roles assigned.

## 5. What is the difference between categories and tags?

Categories and tags are both vocabular lists created within taxonomies. *Categories* are specifically tied to a particular feature and are used to organize the feature within the defined terms. *Tags* are terms that can be shared amongst all features and help tie all the features together under common terms.

## 6. Do I need to update my PDF and Powerpoint files before?

It is a good idea to update all your important and current documents to conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards. Providing documents in a range of formats will enable people with different abilities and learning styles to choose the format that works best for them. The Diversity and Human Rights department has a [webpage dedicated to document accessibility](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/information-and-communication-document-accessibility) that clients should visit for more information on how to update their content.

## 7. Who gets fined if a website is non-compliant?

No cases have been brought to light yet so it is uncertian how events will ultimately unfold. However, the responsibility for website conformity rests on the Site Manager(s) and so it will be their duty to ensure the  content posted adheres to WCAG 2.0 standards.

## 8. Why is there a WYSIWYG editor for location in events?

The remediation team has many clients with different needs and so we have opted to create a solution that can adapt to as many client needs as possible. The WYSIWYG editor allows this.

## 9. Why is there no map option? / How do I embed a Google Map into my website?

The option to embed a Google Map into your website is currently not availiable but will be in the future. Currently, we suggest that you provide an image of the map with alternative text. Along with the image, we encourage you to provide alternative routes, nearby landmarks, and other notable information in the form of text so visually impaired and low vision users have access to the information.

## 10. Does the news archive get generated automatically?

Yes. Once a news item is created it gets automatically added to the news archive in `/news` as well as added to the news list teaser.

## 11. In the news feature, does the "posted" date change every time someone edits?

No. The posted date does not change if a user edits the news item. The only time the news item's date will change is if someone edits the authoring date at the bottom of the edit section.

## 12. Can we add an image slideshow in body of page?

You may add individual images but nothing has been designed to allow an image slideshow.

## 13. Who can I contact to get accesss to SiteImprove?

Please [contact Diversity and Human Rights](https://www.uoguelph.ca/diversity-human-rights/accessibility/) for SiteImprove access. 

## 14. Who do I contact to add additional users to my site?

Please contact the AODA Remediation Team to add additional authors/editors/sitemanagers to your site.

## 15. Are there RSS feeds?

Yes! With the Drupal platform you have the ability to include RSS feeds as through the [Social Media content type](features/howto-socialmedia.md).

## 16. Can you change heading colour and font?

No, you cannot. In order to limit the ammount of ways a site can become inaccessible, the CMS solution we have developed keeps all headings, font colours, and sizes consistant accross all pages. This also allows for a more unified University of Guelph branding.

## 17. Am I responsible for making sure a PDF file is accessible if it is from another website?

It is the responsibility of the owner/creator of PDFs and other documents to ensure their content conforms to WCAG 2.0 AA standards. It is recommended to not host documents on your webpage if you are not the owner or creator of them, though. Instead, link to the original webpage where the PDF can be accessed.

## 18. Why can't other people see the changes I just made to the website?

When you are logged into Drupal you see the most recent changes made to the site when you load a page. For other users, Drupal saves a copy of the website (cache). This "cached" copy of the website will update itself with your new changes anywhere between 5 mins to an hour after making your changes. Thus, if others are not able to see the changes you've just made, their Drupal cache has most likely not updated and they have to wait.
