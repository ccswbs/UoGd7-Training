## Workbench Overview

Drupal Workbench is accessed from the administration bar, by selecting `My Workbench`. Here, you will see your profile and a collection of the site content you have authored and edited. The Workbench page has two main tabs: "My Content," and "Create Content." Selecting `Create Content` is an alternative to selecting `Add content` on the main administration bar.

If you are the site manager, you will also see tabs called "My Drafts" and "Needs Review."

## Workbench Moderation

Clients can contact CCS Web & Development Solutions to request the enabling of the Workbench moderation feature. This feature sets publishing restrictions for the site, such that created content must be approved by the site manager(s) before it can be published. This allows more oversight and can help in catching potential accessibility issues before they go live.

Moderation can be enabled for all content, or only selected content types (basic page, news, events, etc.), according to your needs.
