## Workbench Overview

Drupal Workbench is accessed from the administration bar, by selecting `My Workbench`. Here, you will see your profile and a collection of the site content you have authored and edited. For content authors, the Workbench page has two main tabs: "My Content" and "Create Content." Selecting `Create Content` is an alternative to selecting `Add content` on the main administration bar.

### My Content Tab

This tab organizes your content. You will see lists called "My Edits" and "All Recent Content." The My Content tab also has two sub-tabs, also called "My Edits" and "All Recent Content." Using these sub-tabs allows you to search each list by title, type, and publishing status.

## Workbench Moderation

Clients can contact CCS Web & Development Solutions to request the enabling or disabling of the Workbench moderation feature. This feature sets publishing restrictions for the site, such that created content must be approved by a publisher before it can be published. This allows more oversight and can help in catching potential issues before they go live. 

If moderation is enabled, content authors/editors will see a third tab called "My Drafts" appear under "My Workbench." This section stores a list of created content that is currently unpublished and awaiting moderation. Publishers will see a fourth tab called "Needs Review." This is where created content will appear for moderation before being published.

### My Drafts Tab

When you create and save content, it can be found in the My Drafts tab in My Workbench. When a draft is complete and ready for review, select `Change to Needs Review` under "Set Moderation State." This action will send the content to the publisher for review before publication.

### Needs Review Tab

If you are the publisher, you have access to the Needs Review tab in My Workbench. From here, you can view the moderation history for a piece of content, edit the draft if needed, and publish content. You can also search content by name and type.
